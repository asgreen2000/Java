## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).


# Problem
There is a row of n coins whose values are some positive integers c1, c2,...,cn, 

not necessarily distinct. The goal is to pick up the maximum amount of money 

subject to the constraint that no two coins adjacent

in the initial row can be picked up.

# Introduce to algorithm solving Coin row problem

Algorithm written in java. Source code in file Solution.java


# Analyze this algorithms
Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)
